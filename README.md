Event Observer
==============

Create and observe events, with promises.

You can create events and observer with fluid method or you can use API directly to have more control over your implementation.

This library is typical example of observer design pattern and can be used as a learning asset. An observer is always observes the events. Events notifies it's observers when they are resolved.

AMD, CommonJS and browser globals are supported.

Even though the library is ready to use now, it will take some time to publish it as NPM package.
